The ROS2 KUKA Sunrise driver is being developed and maintained by the kroshu team, but everyone is welcome to contribute. Please take the following aspects into consideration when making contributions:

- By default the Git ["Fork and Branch"](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/) workflow should be followed.
- To foster a high quality product, feature extensions and improvements shall be done after careful design choices. Therefore, design documents and discussion with the maintainers prior to any development is strongly encouraged to make sure that everyone agrees on the issue and the suggested solution. Depending on the individual case the way to do this could be through a GitHub issue, a pull request to the design drafts folder or a new discussion on the repository's Discussions forum.
- Code quality in this repository is monitored via industrial_ci and SonarCloud. All changes must pass the checks performed by these. (There is some flexibility to test coverage)
